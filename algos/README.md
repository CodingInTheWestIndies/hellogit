Simple Algorithms
===================

A basic project to use some simple algorithms.


Linear Search
-------------
This  algorithm runs in 𝛳 (𝑛) iterations in the worst case.

+ To compile, use the command `make search`
+ Run with the command  `make run-search`



Sorting
-----------

To do

+ Create file `sort.cpp`
+ **Pick any one to implement** (They all use 𝛳 (𝑛²) iterations) 
+ To compile, use the command `make sort`
+ Run with the command  `make run-sort`
